> Your basic counter example, but React Server Components and Server Actions

## Project

The project was created to recreate [basic React counter examples](https://react.dev/learn#updating-the-screen) used to represent client-side state, but with a server-driven approach using React Server Components and Server Actions.

- [React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2023/03/22/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-march-2023#react-server-components)
- [Server Action](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form#handle-form-submission-with-a-server-action)

## Demo

A counter that is updated every time a button is clicked, with the data being derived from the server. The timer exists to demonstrate that the client-side state persists. Also, with javascript disabled the functionality continues to work.
